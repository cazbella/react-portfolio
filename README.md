## Description
Welcome to my React Portfolio! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and interactive way. Built using React, this portfolio provides a dynamic and responsive user interface to explore my professional journey.

Features:
- Responsive Design: The portfolio is designed to be accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
- Project Showcase: A dedicated section highlights key projects, each with detailed information, images, and links to the deployed application or repositories.
- Contact Form: Allows visitors to get in touch with me easily through a contact form. The logic to send data to a server is not present (yet), but you can see in the console that the state is changed and data is set. 
- CV - A copy of my CV and a link to a PDF version
