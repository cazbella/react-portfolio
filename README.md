Welcome to my React Portfolio! This project serves as a showcase of my skills, projects, and experiences in a visually appealing and interactive way. Built using React, this portfolio provides a dynamic and responsive user interface to explore my professional journey. My motivation for this project is to showcase my skills so far in Web Development.

Features:
- Responsive Design: The portfolio is designed to be accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.
- Skills - A comprehensive list of the skills I have gained so far as a front end developer.
- Project Showcase: A dedicated section highlights key projects, each with detailed information, images, and links to the deployed application and repositories.
- CV - A copy of my CV and a link to a PDF version.
- Contact Form: Allows visitors to get in touch with me easily through a contact form. The logic to send data to a server is not present (yet), but you can see in the console that the state is changed and data is set. This page also includes another link to the CV as well as links to my email address, linked-in and Facebook profiles in order to ontact me via these methods. 

### Challenges

Getting started with this project was TOUGH! This was because it was so very different to other projects I have done. Using react is very involved and takes a lot of getting used to. Linking all the files and installing dependencies took a lot of time. As usual, CSS took me hours but I am pleased with the results. Deploying it to GitHub Pages was also a challenge. I have learned that everything must be imported and exported before the application will work, and there are many interacting things that could go wrong!

### Credit

I had help from my tutor and ask BCS for this challenge. I also used Stack Overflow extensively, as well as the React, Bootstrap and FontAwesome docs. I also used lots of code examples from the lessons this week.
